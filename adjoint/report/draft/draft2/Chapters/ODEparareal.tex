\chapter{Parallel in time ODE solver methods}
The process of resolving time dependent differential equation in temporal direction, is an exercise which one would intuitively think is unsuited for parallelization. This is due to the simple fact that the solution of such equation at every time $T$ depends on the solution at times $t<T$, and it is therefore very difficult to partition the solution process into independent tasks that can be run in parallel. However the so called parareal scheme introduced by Lions, Maday and Turinici in \cite{lions2001resolution} makes it possible parallelize differential equations in time. 
\subsection{The parareal scheme}
The parareal scheme is used to parallelize differential equations in temporal direction, by decomposing the time interval $I=[0,T]$. The equation looks like the following:
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + Au = f \ 				\textit{For $t \in I$} \\
		u(0)=u_0
	\end{array}
   \right.			
\end{align} 
Decomposing the interval $I$, means dividing the interval into $N$ subintervals $\{I_n = [T^{n},T^{n+1}]\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$, with length $\Delta T = T/N$. We also define new equations for each interval:
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{\partial u^n}{\partial t} + Au^n = f \ 				\textit{For $t \in I^n$} \\
		u^n(T^n)=\lambda^n
	\end{array}
\right.	
\end{align}
Here $\lambda^0=u_0$. If the $\lambda$s are known, we can solve the equations independently on each interval. The problem is that the $\lambda$s depend on the previous intervals, and need to be calculated by solving the equation. The parareal scheme is a way of dealing with this.
\section{The parareal scheme} 
The parareal scheme finds the $\lambda$s, by solving the equation on the entire interval using an implicit euler scheme on a very course resolution, and then using this numerical solution $Y$ at the decomposed interval boundaries $\{T^n\}_{n=1}^{N-1}$ as $\lambda$s, for the real solver $y$. We can then repeat this process, by propagating the jumps $S^n=y^{n-1}(T^n)-Y^n$ using the course scheme. This creates an iteration, that looks like this:
\begin{align*}
&(i) \ \textit{Set $S^n_k = y_k^{n-1}(T^n)-Y_k^n$} \\
&(ii) \ \textit{Propogate the jumps with the couarse scheme $\delta_k$ using (\ref{propagator})} \\
&(iii) \ \textit{Update $Y_{k+1}^n=y_k^{n-1}(T^n) + \delta_k^n$}
\end{align*} 
\\
\\
To illustrate how it works, I will set up the parareal scheme for a simple ODE:
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t)=-ay(t) \ 				\textit{on $[0,T]$} \\
		y(0)=y_0
	\end{array}
\right.	\label{ODE_eks}
\end{align}
If we discretize (\ref{ODE_eks}) using implicit euler, we get:
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{Y^{n+1}-Y^{n}}{\Delta T}+aY^{n+1}=0  \\
		Y^0=y_0
	\end{array}
\right.	\label{couarse_euler}
\end{align}
Notice that the interval $I$, is discretized using the same time difference as the time decomposition. Then we introduce $N$ new equations on each interval, i.e.
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{\partial y^n}{\partial t}(t)=-ay^n(t) \ 				\textit{on $[T_n,T_{n+1}]$} \\
		y(T_n)=Y^n
	\end{array}
\right. \label{interval_eqs}
\end{align}
We can now solve (\ref{interval_eqs}) independently either exactly or using some numerical scheme. So if we first solve (\ref{couarse_euler}) and then (\ref{interval_eqs}), and define $Y_1^n=Y^n$, $y_1^n(t)=y^n(t)$, we can set an initial jump $S_1^n=y_1^{n-1}(T^n)-Y_1^n$ and start the iterative jump propagation process. Lets now specify, whet is meant by \textit{propagate the jumps with the course scheme}:
\begin{align}
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{\delta_k^{n+1}-\delta_k^{n}}{\Delta T}+a\delta_k^{n+1}=\frac{S_k ^n}{\Delta T}  \\
		\delta_k^0=0
	\end{array}
\right. \label{propagator}
\end{align}
