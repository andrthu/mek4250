\chapter*{Abstract}
We propose a parallel in time method for reducible optimal control problems with differential equation constraints. Our method is a combination of the quadratic penalty method from constrained optimization and the BFGS algorithm with a Parareal-based preconditioner. The idea of the method, is to introduce parallelism by decomposing the time interval into several subintervals. The state and adjoint equations are then solved in parallel on these subintervals. To be able to do this we need intermediate initial conditions on the subintervals, and to conserve the continuity of the state equation we need extra constraints that involve these intermediate initial conditions. To remove the new constraints we apply the quadratic penalty method, which transforms constrained optimization problems into constrained problems by altering the objective function. The altered objective function is then minimized using a preconditioned BFGS algorithm that involves ideas from the Parareal algorithm.

We explained our method through an ODE constrained example problem. We also verified and tested our implementation of the method on this particular example. For this particular example we were able to achieve modest speedup results between 9 and 23.5 on 48 to 120 cores. We also observed that the cost of our method, at least for the example problem, seems to be independent of the number of decompositions of the time interval.
