\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to start by offering my thanks to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo (UiO) for giving me the opportunity to carry out this master thesis. A special thanks goes to Simula Research Laboratory for making it possible for me to write my master thesis in an excellent research environment, and for providing localities for studying as well as generous benefits.

I would particularity like to thank my supervisor Simon Wolfgang Funke for his invaluable input and direction, and for our constructive and informative weekly meetings. Without your help, guidance and positive attitude, the completion of this thesis would not have been possible. I appreciate the remarks and comments offered by my secondary supervisor Kent Andre Mardal, especially for his contributions at the beginning of this project.

I thank UNIK at UiO for permission to use The Abel computer cluster, which has been a valuable tool in the work on this thesis.
