\chapter{Literature review}
The Parareal algorithm was introduced by Lions, Maday and Turinici in \cite{lions2001resolution} as a way to solve differential evolution equations in parallel. This is done by combining a coarse and fine scheme for discretization in time. To introduce parallelism we first decompose the time domain $I=[0,T]$ into $N$ subintervals $I_i=[T_{i-1},T_i]$. The equation is first solved sequentially on the entire interval using the coarse scheme, so that we get an approximation of the solution, to be used as initial conditions for the fine solver on the decomposed subintervals $I_i$. The fine solver can then be applied to each subinterval individually, and therefore also be run in parallel. This process is then repeated in an iteration, where new initial conditions for the decomposed subintervals, to be used in the parallel fine solver, are found by propagating the differences, at times $T_i$, between the coarse and fine solutions from the last iteration using the coarse scheme. The version of Parareal presented in \cite{lions2001resolution} is only defined for linear equations. An alternative but  of the algorithm is found in \cite{baffico2002parallel}. The formulation given here is equivalent to the one in \cite{lions2001resolution} for linear equations, but is easier applied to non-linear equations.

A lot of the work done on the Parareal algorithm, has been focused on establishing its stability and convergence properties. The stability results are found in \cite{staff2005stability} and \cite{bal2005convergence}, where Staff in \cite{staff2005stability} derives sufficient conditions for the stability of Parareal for autonomous differential equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} =\rho y,\quad y(0)=y_0,\quad  \rho<0 \label{autonom E}
\end{align}
while \cite{bal2005convergence} presents more general stability results for parabolic equations. The stability of Parareal applied is a more difficult for hyperbolic equations \cite{dai2013stable}. The convergence of Parareal is studied in \cite{lions2001resolution},\cite{bal2005convergence},\cite{gander2007analysis} and \cite{gander2007superlinear}.

Different applications of the algorithm exists for example on the Navier-Stokes problem\cite{fischer2005parareal}, for molecular-dynamics simulations\cite{baffico2002parallel}, on stochastic ordinary differential equations\cite{bal2003parallelization}, fluid-structure\cite{farhat2003time}, or on the American put\cite{bal2002parareal}.

Since the Parareal algorithm is an iterative procedure, a stopping criteria for when to terminate the iteration is required. This is done in \cite{lepsa2010efficient}, where an error control mechanism for the Parareal algorithm to limit the number of Parareal iterations is introduced. The stopping criteria that they propose, is to stop the algorithm when the difference between coarse and fine solution at the subinterval boundaries $T_i$ are similar to the expected global error of the fine solver. One issue with Parareal, is that increasing the number of decompositions of the time domain, which we need to do if we want to increase the number of processes, will make the coarse discretization finer. This represents a possible bottleneck for speedup, which is adressed in \cite{rao2014adjoint}, where the authors try to parallelize PDEs in time in a scalable way, by only doing an initial coarse sequential solve, and thereafter doing everything in parallel. As mentioned in \cite{gander2007superlinear} the Parareal algorithm is not the first attempt to parallelize the solution of time dependent differential equation in temporal direction, since Nievergelt already in 1964 proposed a procedure in \cite{nievergelt1964parallel} that eventually led to the so called multiple shooting methods. A historic overview of the development of parallel in time algorithms can be found in \cite{gander201550}.

In the paper \cite{maday2002parareal}, Maday and Turinici reinterpret the Parareal algorithm as a prconditioner for the algebraic system of equations arising when we decompose the time domain. This reinterpretation allows us to extend the parallelization of evolution equations into parallelization of optimal control with evolution equation constraints. When evaluating the gradient of the objective functions for such problems, we typically need to solve the evolution equation forward in time, and then its adjoint backwards in time, and we want to apply the coarse solver to both of these equations. The optimal control problem looked at in \cite{maday2002parareal} is the following:
\begin{align*}
&\min_{y,u}J(y,u) = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T||u(t)||_U^2dt + \frac{\alpha}{2}||y(T)-y^T||^2,\\
&\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       	\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}+Ay = Bu\\
       	   y(0)=y_0
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{align*}
In the same way as for time dependent differential equations, we introduce parallelism to the above problem by decomposing the time interval. To enforce continuity in the state $y$, we add jumps in the solution of the state equation as penalties into the objective function $J$. The initial conditions at each decomposed subinterval then become variables in $J$, and it is these variables that the Parareal preconditioner effects. The preconditioner for the optimal control problem can also be used as a modified Parareal algorithm, that is stable for hyperbolic equation \cite{chen2015adjoint},
\\

In \cite{rao2016time} the authors use the Parareal preconditioner approach for time-parallel 4d variational data assimilation, but enforce the state equation continuity with the augmented Lagrangian method, which is a modification of the penalty method\cite{nocedal2006numerical}. As mentioned the Parareal preconditioner presented in \cite{maday2002parareal} only affects the penalty terms. A more advanced preconditioner is derived in \cite{ulbrich2015preconditioners}, where the Parareal preconditioner is incorporated into a preconditioner for a control problem with time-dependent partial differential equation constraints and inequality constraints.
